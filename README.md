# **ARC: Academic Research Consultation**

### Project Overview
Arc: Academic Research Consultation is a digitalized research consultation system that is a web-based application _designed to simplify and digitalize_ the consultation process between students and faculy members. A digitalized research consultation system would make it easier for students to conveniently check availability, book slots, and communication with their professors without the hassle of chasing them in person.

  #### Objective:
  1. Allow students to conveniently request and schedule research consultations with faculty advisers without the need to physically visit the faculty room, ensuring a more efficient and accessible consultation process.
  2. Enable faculty members to set their consultation schedules, manage requests, and track student appointments efficiently, reducing scheduling conflicts and supporting better time management.
  3. Provide real-time availability updates so students can easily check adviser availability, minimizing missed opportunities and unnecessary waiting.
  4. Ensure secure and efficient user registration, authentication, and profile management for students, faculty, and administrators to maintain system integrity and proper access control.
  5.  Support research collaboration through effective communication, file sharing, and research proposal management, allowing students to submit their work digitally and receive timely adviser feedback
